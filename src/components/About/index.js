          Meet Mitchell Frey, an amateur coder with aspirations of becoming a
          professional programmer. His interest in programming began with his
          work in video and audio editing, which introduced him to many concepts
          utilized in the development of code. After encouragement by his
          friends and family, he decided to pursue this interest in coding by
          taking an online Coding Bootcamp offered by Michigan State University
          through Trilogy Education. He is also a professional musician with a
          Masters in Music from Indiana University, though due to the COVID-19
          pandemic cancelling most music events (and thus halting his music
          career), he decided to pursue his other interest of programming.
